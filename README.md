## Usage

Below we have listed some basic examples. You can find more information about the usage within the [docs/](docs/) folder.

### Utils
If you need to access several utility functions:

```go
import {
  keptnutils "github.com/keptn/go-utils/pkg/utils"
}
```

Logging Example:
```go
keptnutils.Debug(keptncontext, message)
keptnutils.Info(keptncontext, message)
keptnutils.Error(keptncontext, message)
```

### CloudEvent Data
If you need to access data within CloudEvents:

```go
import {
	keptnevents "github.com/keptn/go-utils/pkg/events"
)
```

Example:

```go
func parseCloudEvent(event cloudevents.Event) (keptnevents.TestFinishedEventData, error) {
	eventData := &keptnevents.TestsFinishedEventData{}
	err := event.DataAs(eventData)
    
    return eventData, err
}
```

### Models
If you need to access Models for YAML files:

```go
import {
	keptnmodels "github.com/keptn/go-utils/pkg/models"
)
```

## Updating model definitions
After updating the model definitions in the `swagger.yaml` file, execute the command

```
swagger generate model --spec=swagger.yaml -t=./pkg/api/
```

to update the models located in `./pkg/api/models`

## Automation

Within [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) we have included an automation that creates a Pull Request to 
 [github.com/keptn/keptn](https://github.com/keptn/keptn) to update `go.mod` files with an updated version of this 
 package (based on the commit hash). To make this work, a `GITHUB_TOKEN` (personal access token) 
 needs to be added within the [travis-ci settings page](https://travis-ci.org/keptn/go-utils/settings).
